		<p>An Orange Lazarus is a dangerous thing. Consumed too quickly, it can shut down a drinker's central nervous system in 1.2 seconds. Oppenheimer created it looking for beauty and perfection, but instead created a "hedonistic nectar of greed and power."" It's "too tempting, too delicious, too cold."" You think you drink it? "No, it drinks you."</p>
		<p> The second album by Smiling Strange took advantage of a long weekend in the Boston Suburb of Concord. This is the first attempt to create a cohesive whole as opposed to individual songs. The album features music primarily of Evan and Kyle Rosse, with added help by Sophia Rosse, Katherine Sartiano, and Mikey Corenthal</p>
