		<p> Walls were paper thin and we could hear everything going on in adjoining rooms. Thus, sleeping was an issue due to the noise levels. Also, many items were missing from the breakfast buffet including coffee (pot was empty,) and spoons (no way to eat cereal with milk,)</p>
		<p>The first Smiling Strange album, mostly recorded on reel to reel in dorm rooms and unreleased for year. First time collected together. Originally named "Alicia Marie Ganon", who could be heard on the original tape on the reel to reel. It is assumed that the recording device belonged to her family</p>
