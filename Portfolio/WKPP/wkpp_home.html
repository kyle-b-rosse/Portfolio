			<h3>June 2015</h3>
			<p>It has been many years since WKPP has gone off the air, it's limited financial resources finally run dry, or so I am left to assume. For what it's worth I have found no authoritative history of the end days of the station, have been fruitless in my search for any and all personnel who may have been there near the end. There had never been much news on the station, it's viewers were not outgoing people prone to talk to strangers and friends about that station on the end of the dial that only played music late at night. It did not pack the right elements of mystery to make it hip, or cool. I have my theories, the music wasn't always great, the personalities had their charm but lacked any polish. It was not enthusiastic enough to be endearing, it wasn't cruel enough to posses edge, and it was not angry enough to wear it's differences as a badge of distinction. There was humor, but it may or may not have been intentional and that lack of distinction was sometimes more embarrassing than enjoyable. It was, in a sense, bad, but not bad enough to be good.</p>
			<br>
			<p>And yet it hung in there for a couple of uneasy years. I've found in the years since it's airwaves turned static that there are three types of people when it came to WKPP. Group one was the majority, people who knew it as a station that relayed weather information during the day and that had no idea music was even played late at night. Then there were the people who did know, many of the local scene kids and people in bands around town, but they knew the station second hand. They had heard about it, maybe even listened to it once and a while, but had never really cared for it. The station held no place in their lives and who can blame them. There are many stations that we don't listen to. Many of these kids were too cool for radio anyway, said that nothing good was played over the airwaves.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The third group, my comrades in airwave exploration, were the people that had stumbled onto the music themselves. As far as I've met, it seems that no one who was told to listen to WKPP ever stayed around long. It was for the people who found it themselves, awake at the odd hours, alone, unable to fall asleep and needing some other voice to fill their heads.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I was young and restless and WKPP was my companion. The soundtrack to when the night was mine and mine alone. The music may not have been great, but it was mine which gave it purpose. Maybe this sense of discovery lead to a sense of ownership which bred in it responsibility. I like to think that the station was able to give off faint hints of quiet desperation, the sounds of inevitable financial failure that, for some, was impossible to ignore. It was an experience that today is still unmatched. Failing enterprises today become desperate, start to beg. They bring down the illusion of control and begin to panic like passengers on a ship. WKPP allowed us to play along, to embrace the importance of the listener while at the same time allowing the station to distract and comfort us. In that way we were both lying to each other, saying everything was going to be alright, while still being aware of the inevitable.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I have had these tapes since near when I first discovered WKPP. I was young, maybe 14 or 15, and I had just been gifted a stereo with a recordable tape deck. I don't remember if it was a birthday gift or a christmas gift, or something my step-father was planning on throwing away until I intervened, but I was exploring the functions or the tape deck and wanted to practice making mix tapes. In my mind, I think, I planned on one day giving these to some dark and quiet crush who would then immediately understand. But, like any listener to WKPP, I found time and again that no one ever brought to the station stayed, and so I gave up. But I did not stop recording the broadcast, even though the original purpose dried up and was never replaced.</p>
			<br>
			<p>And so I have come to the questions you are most likely asking, and I will do my best to answer them. No, I do not have any connection to the station or anyone in it. I have no idea what happened or how it ended, but I do have my fantasies. I do not plan on selling any of this for profit, I intend it only for those who are interested, curious, or otherwise compelled. I understand that the tapes are incomplete, but they, like myself, have gotten older and seen better days. I will not be uploading them all at once as this will stay as little more than a passion project for me. I have spent many hours of my life thinking about this station, in fact I have been in the habit of listening to it's now constant white noise as a sleep aid, and I would like to keep it in itâ€™s place. I am only a messenger at this point, and seeing as all traces of this once kind moment in my life have seemed to vanish, I feel somewhat obligated. These are moments I have done my best to preserve, and I would simply like to share them while I can. Thank you, and in the forgotten words of Midnight or Later "Sometimes we're just alright."</p>
